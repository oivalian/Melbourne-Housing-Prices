# Melbourne-Housing-Prices
Predict Melbourne house prices based on data from 2016 sales.

> [!CAUTION]
>  This model will not predict current housing prices and is only relevant to data from Jan 2016.

## Information

This is my first machine learning model using a Gradient Boosting Regressor. It predicts Melbourne housing prices based on data from 2016.
The baseline of this model was included in Oliver Theobald's [_Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners(Third Edition)_](https://www.amazon.com.au/Machine-Learning-Absolute-Beginners-Introduction-ebook/dp/B08RWBSKQB) Though validation has been carried out using different techniques and hyperparameters have been selected based on grid search _best params_.

Though this model is accurate enough, it needs ALOT more work. I intend to make one based on Sydney's current market next.

Once I wrap my head around more ML, I intend to make a few projects that are weather/climate based. Maybe even a cloud recognition model using CNN! Who knows ... 

### Dataset

This model uses Tony Pino's [Melbourne Housing Market](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market/discussion/53664) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
